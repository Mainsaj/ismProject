                    My name is Alex Mains. I have been figure skating for over twenty years. Over this time I have seen both the recreational side of figure skating and the competitive side. I began skating at the age of four when my father wanted me to play Hockey. I fell in love with the sport and began to skate year round and compete at age ten. In 2011 I placed 4th at the Upper Great Lakes Regional Championships at the Intermediate level and went on to place 21st overall at the Junior National Championships that same year. I am rated Senior in Moves in the Field and Novice in Freeskate by the United Skates Figure Skating Association. I am also a registered coach with both the United States Figure Skating Association and Learn to Skate USA.
